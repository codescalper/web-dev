/* Why i need to speciy header main and footer even though it lies in body */


/*  
 That's a great question! Yes, header, main, and footer are child elements of the body, but in this case, you want to set their width and text-alignment properties individually, so you need to specify them.

By specifying width: 80% for header, main, and footer, you're setting the width of each of these elements to 80% of the parent element's width (i.e. the body element).

And by specifying text-align: center, you're aligning the text content of each of these elements to the center.

By setting these properties for header, main, and footer, you're ensuring that the width and alignment of these elements will be independent of their parent element. */
